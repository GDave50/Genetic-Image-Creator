# Genetic Image Creator
The genetic image creator is a genetic algorithm which takes a population of small images with random pixels and produces an image with clustered pixels of the same color. The evolution works by using mutation and crossover of images to produce images with more clustered colors.

# Genetic Image Display
The genetic image display is a supplementary program written in Java. The program takes the text-formatted image produced by the genetic algorithm and displays it in color.
